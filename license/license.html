				become in the public domain through no act or omission of Recipient; (b) was known to Recipient, without
				restriction, at the time of disclosure as shown by the files of Recipient in existence at the time of
				disclosure; (c) was disclosed by Recipient with the prior written approval of Discloser; (d) was

				became known to Recipient, without restriction, from a source other than Discloser without breach of
				this Agreement by Recipient and otherwise not knowingly in violation of Discloser’s rights.</p>

			<h2>Restrictions on Use and Disclosure. </h2>
			<p>Recipient agrees not to use Discloser’s Confidential Information or disclose, distribute, or disseminate
				Discloser’s Confidential Information except in furtherance of the performance of its obligations or
				enforcement of its rights hereunder or as otherwise expressly agreed by Discloser in writing.</p>

			<h2>Compelled Disclosure. </h2>
			<p>If Recipient is compelled by a court or other competent authority or applicable law to disclose
				Confidential Information of Discloser, it shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, give
				Discloser prompt written notice and shall provide Discloser with reasonable cooperation at Discloser’s
				expense so that Discloser may take steps to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order.
				Recipient shall not be in breach of its obligations in this Section 11 if it makes any legally compelled
				disclosure provided that Recipient meets the foregoing notice and cooperation requirements. </p>

			<h2>Injunctive Relief. </h2>
			<p>Recipient acknowledges that breach of the confidentiality obligations may cause irreparable harm to
				Discloser, the extent of which may be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that
				Discloser may be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event of breach of an obligation of
				confidentiality by Recipient, and that Discloser shall not be required to post a bond or show
				irreparable harm in order to obtain such injunctive relief.</p>

			<h2>Return of Confidential Information. </h2>
			<p>As between the parties, Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Discloser. At any time,
				upon Discloser’s reasonable request, Recipient shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days) return

				in Recipient’s possession. In addition, within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, Recipient
				shall (i) promptly return all tangible materials containing such Confidential Information to Discloser,

				Recipient and confirm in writing that all materials containing Confidential Information have been

			<h1>Indemnification. </h1>

			<h2>Limitation on liability</h2>
			<p>By Stack8. Subject to the limitation on liability set forth in Section 15, Stack8 shall defend at its own
				expense any legal action brought against you to the extent that it is based on a claim or allegation
				that the Service (excluding any Open Source Software) infringes a U.S. patent or copyright of a third
				party, and Stack8 will pay any costs and damages awarded against you in any such action, or agreed to
				under a settlement signed by Stack8, that are attributable to any such claim but shall not be
				responsible for any compromise made or expense incurred without Stack8’s consent. Such defense and
				payments are subject to the conditions that you (a) give Stack8 prompt written notice of such claim, (b)
				tender to Stack8 sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, and (c) reasonably cooperate
				with Stack8 when requested in connection with the defense and settlement of the claim. Stack8 will have
				no liability to so defend and pay for any infringement claim to the extent it (i) is based on
				modification of the Service other than by Stack8, with or without authorization; (ii) results from your
				failure to use an updated version of the Service; or (iii) is based on the combination or use of the
				Service with any software (including, without limitation, Open Source Software), program or device not
				provided by Stack8 if such infringement would not have arisen but for such use or combination; or (iv)
				results from use of the Service by you after the license was terminated. </p>

			<h2>Limitation on Infringement Claims. </h2>
			<p>Stack8 will have no liability to Customer Indemnitees or any obligations under this Section 14 to the
				extent a claim arise out of:</p>

			<h2>Modification</h2>
			<p>(a) the modification of any portion of the Service by any party other than Stack8 or its authorized
				representatives; (b) the combination, operation, or use of any Service with other product(s), data,
				third party software, or services where the Service would not by itself be infringing; (c) the continued
				use of the allegedly infringing Service after being notified of the infringement claim or after being
				provided a modified version of the Service by Stack8 to address any alleged infringement; or (d) the
				failure to use the Service in accordance with the applicable Documentation or outside the scope of the
				rights granted under this Agreement. Should the Service, or the operation thereof, become or in Stack8’s
				opinion be likely to become, the subject of such claim described in Section 14.1, Stack8 may, at its
				option and expense, (i) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Service, or (ii) replace or
				modify the Service so that it becomes non-infringing. If neither (i) or (ii) are reasonably practicable,
				Stack8 may terminate the applicable Order Form and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused Fees paid by
				Customer corresponding to the unused period of the Subscription Term. THIS SECTION 14 STATES DOCKER’S
				SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY, AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR
				MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.
			</p>

				use by Customer or its Users of the Service in violation of the license restrictions in Section 4.3 of
				this Agreement or violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Service, and
				shall indemnify the Stack8 Indemnitees against any damages, judgments, litigation costs including any
				reasonable attorneys’ fees. </p>

			<h2>Procedure.</h2>
			<p>The party seeking indemnification will notify the indemnifying party promptly of any claim or action
				covered by this Section 14. The parties agree to reasonably cooperate during such proceedings. The
				indemnifying party will have the right to defend any such claim and will have control over the
				litigation, negotiation, and settlement of any such claim, provided it will not make any settlement of a
				claim that results in any liability or imposes any obligation on the indemnified party without the prior
				written consent of such party, which will not be unreasonably withheld. The indemnified party may, at
				its sole expense, participate in the defense of any claim. </p>

			<h2>Exclusion of Damages.</h2>
			<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, CUSTOMER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT DOCKER,

				Service, Customer represents and warrants that Customer is not located in, under the control of, or a
				national or resident of an Embargoed Country or Designated National. Customer agrees to comply with all
				United States export laws and assumes sole responsibility for obtaining United States government export
				licenses to export or re-export as may be required. Customer will defend, indemnify, and hold Stack8 and

				concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and it supersedes all prior and simultaneous proposals,
				agreements, understandings, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such
				subject matter. The terms of an Order Form will prevail over the general terms herein only if such Order
				Form expressly references this Agreement, the intent to prevail over this Agreement, and is signed by
				authorized signatories of both Stack8 and Customer. Section headings are for convenience only and shall
				not affect interpretation of the relevant section. No provision of any purchase order or other form
				employed or provided by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such
