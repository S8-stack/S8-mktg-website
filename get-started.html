			<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
			<p>
				Stack8 is bundled in a simple zip containing all modules and ressources for an easy startup. Virtually
				nothing more is required other than an IDE and the S8 stack that you can download below.

			<h1>Storage</h1>
			<h2>The db-style1</h2>
			<p>
				Every web-app relies at some point on databases. Moreover, the proximity with data is key to write
				easily
				complex treatment. Having noticed this, we came up to think that data must be served efficiently,
				seamlessly
				within the app through very simple accesses directly available in the flow. So every instance running on
				the
				S8 stack have by default the possibility of working with three types of databases, and build as many
				tables,
				objects on the fly.
