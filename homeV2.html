			<h1>Simple</h1>
			<p>The idea of maximum productivity encompasses all aspects of the Saas development and deployment.
				S8 brings a certain number of radical changes to make this it simpler.</p>
			<h2>Language</h2>
			<p>
				First it proposes the development team to reduce to a single language JAVA, that -despite being
				seen as less hype than other new languages- is widely adopted, highly efficient but also very complete
				in terms of features. But have no fear! All the gory aspects of traditional JAVA project development
				have been left behind, to leverage only the very best of language: JAVA core. It’s even more than
				that: JAVA comes with a lot high level functions that require expert level team to master, but
				regarding this, we just ask our user not to use them and to use JAVA as a simpler version of TypeScript.
			</p>
			<h2>Booting fast</h2>
			<p>
				S8 marks a clear cut with traditional web-app deployment on JAVA server (Tomcat, etc.). S8 server-side
				boots in less than 1s on most environments, meaning you don’t care stopping and redeploying an instance
				anytime you want it. This drastically reduces the development cycle by enabling super frequent test
				in real world testing environment. This is especially true for apps with advanced graphics where
				the entire db-back-front is required, even to play unit tests.
			</p>
			<h2>Single man orchestra</h2>
			<p>
				Ok, this is wild. But that’s how we built it. We wanted -day 1- that S8 can be efficiently used to
				build and deploy a project with a record low number of people, so we squeeze all the
				{params, configs, scripts} around to just focus on app development.
				S8 enables to have your server life from any simple JAVA environment.
				We broke the rule of having two servers, one server dedicated for the back and another one for the
				front, and merged everything into a single stack, for the sake of simplicity and efficient project
				management.

			<h1>Secure</h1>
			<h2>Zero dependencies</h2>
			<p>While open source supply with valuable tools and features, it also creates uncontrolled dependencies
				from unchecked origins. Many incidents through two decades illustrated how easily a malicious
				contributor
				can inject vulnerabilities inside applications based on external modules. The number of those
				dependencies
				is out of control for most organizations and this results in random highly critical incidents. With open
				sources modules deeply nested inside layers and layers of code, it becomes virtually impossible to
				guarantee
				a safe system. On top of that, any previously clear dependency can become malevolent through updates.
			</p>
			<p>
				That’s why we decided to rebuild the entire stack from the ground up, carefully crafting and validating
				each of our modules. Therefore, we can guarantee the total absence of the traditional worms inside
				the code you will build on S8.
			</p>
			<h2>HTTPS and all the rest...</h2>
			<p>We also implement HTTP2 and TLS security layer with a somewhat restrictive inner policy to stay on
				the safe side.</p>

			<h1>Small</h1>
			<h2>Small Surface API is the key</h2>
			<p>Small surface API might be seen as a limitation. We see a strength: only key features are here, but
				all key features. This enables a fast learning curve, and an almost immediate kicking off. It also
				offers a serenity for creator, when you know you sit on something that is taking care of fine grain
				details, without having to spend time resolving problems -including integration problems- that have
				been solved so many time. You leverage performance improvement of the entire stack effortlessly.
			</p>
			<h2>Multiple environnement, one API</h2>
			<p>Also, we have plans to build even more aggressive of some module (in a JAVA sense) of current ones,
				and to propose them on future version. Having a high-level API enables you to take advantage of many
				implementations fine tuning with the same codebase. It provides a stable environment, just as JVM
				provides a standardized coding environment over different machines.
			</p>
			<h2>The flow</h2>
			<p>The key concept of this stack relies on the flow. The flow let you access pretty much every feature
				of the stack in an asynchronous and unified way. The flow is the context against which you build
				the big lambda expression which is in the end your app.
			</p>

			<h1>Synced</h1>
			<p>
				One of the main obstacles into writing a scalable application is the proper handling of high
				concurrency through asynchronous task orchestration. Since this is a recurring problem, and a hard
				to solve one, we decided to embedded deep into the S8 stack what we think is the best solution (and
				we have a high-level API that gives us plenty of room to make further improvements under the hood).
				Also, because the S8 stack is managing the server aspects, we needed to have this asynchronous engine
				ready to support the stack inner systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				That’s why we designed a light threads engine with a built-in thread workers pool along with a thread
				allocation mechanism that prevent congestion and enable high scaling up.
			</p>

			<svg path="/assets/principles/servers.svg" width="128" height="128"></svg>
			<h1>Storage</h1>
			<p>
				Every web-app relies at some point on databases. Moreover, the proximity with data is key to write
				easily
				complex treatment. Having noticed this, we came up to think that data must be served efficiently,
				seamlessly
				within the app through very simple accesses directly available in the flow. So every instance running on
				the
				S8 stack have by default the possibility of working with three types of databases, and build as many
				tables,
				objects on the fly.
			</p>
			<h2>Annotations</h2>
			<p>Objects persistency relies on annotating object classes -most robust approach so far. Access to objects
				is exclusively made through the call of methods on the flow, as well as all subsequent actions (saving,
				reverting, etc.).
			</p>
			<h2>Caching<h2>
					<p>Caching is a key part of performance, and one of the goals of S8 is to handle this seamlessly. As
						a result,
						you can make the assumption that data is always readily available since the caching will balance
						memory retention
						to reflect data usage.</p>
					<h2>Scaling and replicating</h2>
					<p>For the scaling up versions, we will provide automatic synchronization of instances running S8
						stack on our cloud to
						ensure that any modifications made to data contained on the databases of one instance are
						replicated to other instances,
						and efficiently handling copies to ensure a given requirement in terms of redundancy.
					</p>

			<h1>Structured</h1>
			<h2>Key-value DB</h2>
			<p>Key value db is probably the most efficient pattern to get data. S8 provides with efficient table-like
				list of objects
				you can search through or retrieve through id, effectively mimicking the core features of NO SQL like
				db. For more advanced
				searches, selection with JAVA queries can be used.
			</p>
			<h2>Structured DB"</h2>
			<p>Structured DB works with large objects, each representing a group of data you can navigate through points
				and methods.
				This group of data typically represent the data of a big project, including hundreds or even hundreds of
				thousands sub
				objects, but that belong to a same logical entity and need to remain grouped from a logical point of
				view (think of the
				plan of a building), even if you can traverse it easily.

			<h1>Screen</h1>
			<p>One thing that makes Saas so time-consuming to develop is that development is split between two realms,
				with deiffrenet
				languages, logics, teams, deployment tools, etc. This gigantically increases the number of skills a team
				must master to
				deliver a webapp. So we came up with something different.</p>
			<h2>Your front as a remote screen</h2>
			<p>When you develop a app that will run on local device (say desktop or mobile), things are much more
				simple: without exiting your development environment, you directly have access to all graphical
				components that come standard
				with the OS, and you can manipulate in any imaginable way, even inside a deeply nested function. You
				don’t have to define an
				API between the back and the front so both can communicate. Everything is fused together, and that’s why
				it is so easy to
				achieve remarkable graphical complexity with minimum effort. We thought it was the way to go for Saas as
				well!
			</p>
			<h2>Additional hidden benefits</h2>
			<p>S8 way of handling the front is radical: each graphical component comes as a JAVA realm object, that you
				can manipulate at
				will, and a ghost counterpart -that you never have to touch- that lives on the front side. Connection
				between both sides of the
				same entity is handled under the hood by S8. The tremendous benefits are the following:
			<ul>
				<li>High compression throughput
				<li>Natural caching strategies of large objects on the front, operated from the back.
				<li>Radical speed improvements when switching of views of large objects (like opening the plan of
					building A, closing it,
					opening plan of building B, closing it and reopening plan of building B).
			</ul>

			<h1>Scalable</h1>
			<p>Scalability is the long-time concern of every project builder. We designed the S8 stack to enable a
				natural and powerful way of scaling up: each node running S8 is a member of a cluster. It is a member of
				a database cluster. It is a member of lambda expression workers pools clusters. It is a member of login
				cluster. And so on. Each node being able to perform the entire set of tasks required by the applications
				enables a smooth and arbitrary large scale up.</p>
